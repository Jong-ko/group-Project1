We created a product entitled "Our Solar System". This product consists of
a landing page for entrance into the site, the main site, & cards that populate our 9 planets
this includes a "more info" button that provides more information on the planets.
With the amount of time we had for this project, we had some difficulty pulling the images into the cards
we are trying to use a mapping function utilizing object keys. This took up a lot of time so we were unable to get to using our 2nd API. We were using our 2nd API to put additional info for the planets to be available for the site user when clicking the "More Info" button.

project work split up as follows:
Chonny fetch api, image HTML files, 
Jeremy handled the DOM
Lauren handled HTML index & landing page, CSS, & readMe file

 Still need to: add the 2nd API so we can make the "more info" button functional
